Unfinished business:

 * Add pooping.
 * Add starvation.
--DONE-- * Add firealarm sound.
__ERROR: LOOKS LIKE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE WITH BYOND__ * Make lobby music stop at game start and make it go to a different song after the current one's finished.
 * Hivebot invasion event.
 * Admin ghost mode (I don't know how to do this in bay12, the command's not the same if it's still here).
 * Add the warthog.
 * Shitbomb command.
 * Heman's song.
 * Clown song.
 * Metroids.
 * Make bay12's narsie some kind of death robot alien and add our old narsie back in.
 * Re-add chickenz.
 * Port our blarg2 map over.
 * Make our own map.
 * Add our terrastation clothing.
 * Our door modifications Tauka did.
 * The weapons we added.
 * Trade shuttle.
 * NPCs.
 * My autofire modification to SMG guns and the like.
 * Respawn times. Load a default respawn time from the configs, and then let admins set the respawn time ingame.
 * Open the changelog and rules on startup.
 * Make the man up button play a cinematic (like the station blowing up): Tom R. Toe (and his music). That'll teach those buggers to CHILL OUT.
 * Fix walking and running speed (maybe).

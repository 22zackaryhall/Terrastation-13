/*Agonists: How the *deuce* do they work?

Potency: Differentiates between full and partial agonists.
Endogenous agonists: Naturally occuring. This is quite simple.
Co-agonist: Probably a list.
Inverse-agonist: Induces reverse effects in a receptor. Flag or negative potency?
Irreversable agonists: Necessarily rare. Duration variable?
Antagonists: List of reagents/chems which suppress an agonist's effects.
